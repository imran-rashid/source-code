Our first attempt at designing a calling app has some issues:

1) We jumped at a solution very quickly. This is a common problem in interviews. Instead of building and communicating our ideas, we are anxious to note them on the board.

2) The explanation isn't in as much depth as we'd like. Although this level of depth is fine for an interview, we'd like to know more.

3) The architecture is quite generic. Not a lot of problems specific to calling have been discussed.

In a few weeks, we shall see a different approach to designing the app. These lessons will tackle the issues mentioned above. Stay tuned!
